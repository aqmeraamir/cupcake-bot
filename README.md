# Cupcake Bot

Cupcake Bot is a Discord bot project designed to enhance your Discord server with various features and utilities. Whether you're looking for moderation tools, fun commands, or information retrieval, Cupcake Bot has got you covered!

I made this a couple of years ago, and I don't intend on working on it anymore. So now, Cupcake Bot is just a functional abandoned project that anyone can freely utilize for their own purposes. Here are some screenshots of the bot in action:

## Features

- Moderation commands to keep your server safe and secure.
- An entire currency system connected to mongodb.
- Fun and interactive commands for entertainment (a whole currency system with games).
- Customizable settings to tailor the bot to your server's needs, for example, a changeable prefix.

## Usage

To add Cupcake Bot to your Discord server, you can use the following link: [Invite Cupcake Bot](https://discord.com/oaut)

Cupcake Bot supports a wide range of commands to enhance your Discord experience. Some of the available commands include:

- `!help`: Display the list of available commands.
- `!kick [user] [reason]`: Kick a user from the server.

Refer to the bot's command help for a complete list of commands and their usage.
